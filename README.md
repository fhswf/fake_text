# Create artificial German texts
In February 2019, [OpenAI](https://openai.com) published a 
[blog entry on the GPT-2 laguage model](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/) 
that allows to create high-quality artificial texts in English language.

For German, a pre-trained model is made available by [Zamia Brain](https://zamia.org/brain/). 
Although it is based on a much smaller text corpus, it can be used to create quite 
impressive artificial German texts.

A demo application is available at [jupiter.fh-swf.de/fake_text](https://jupiter.fh-swf.de/fake_text/index.html).
